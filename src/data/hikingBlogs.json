    "content": "After months of training and planning, I finally summited Mount Rainier! Here's everything I learned:\n\n**Training**: Started 6 months out with stair climbing (with weighted pack), cardio, and strength training. The altitude hit harder than expected!\n\n**Gear Essentials**: Crampons, ice axe, and layering system were crucial. Rented mountaineering boots - glad I tested them first.\n\n**The Climb**: We started at midnight from Camp Muir. The headlamp-lit glacier was surreal. Sunrise from 14,000 feet? Absolutely magical.\n\n**Tips for First-Timers**:\n- Hire a guide service (I used RMI)\n- Train at altitude if possible  \n- Don't underestimate the mental challenge\n- Bring twice as many snacks as you think you need\n\nWould I do it again? Absolutely!",

    "content": "Full disclosure: I'm afraid of heights. So why did I attempt Angels Landing?\n\n**Mental Prep**:\n- Watched videos (helps to know what to expect)\n- Reminded myself: thousands do this safely every year\n- Went with an experienced friend\n\n**The Reality**:\nThe chain section is 0.5 miles of exposed climbing. It's narrow, it's steep, and yes, it's scary. But:\n- The chains are VERY secure\n- There's always a handhold\n- You can take it at your own pace\n- People are super supportive\n\n**My Strategy**:\n1. Started at 6am to avoid crowds and heat\n2. Focused on the next chain, not the drop\n3. Took breaks at wider sections\n4. Three-point contact always\n5. Going DOWN was actually easier!\n\n**Was It Worth It?**\nAbsolutely. The views are incredible, and I'm so proud I pushed through my fear. Start early, take your time, and you've got this!",
